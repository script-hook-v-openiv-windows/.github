# 🧩 Script Hook V + OpenIV – GTA V Modding Toolkit for Windows

📌 **About Script Hook V + OpenIV (Windows)**
Script Hook V + OpenIV is a Windows toolkit for **GTA V** single‑player modding: install **ASI scripts**, manage **RPF archives**, replace **textures/models**, and configure **game files** with backups. The workflow integrates Script Hook V’s ASI loader and native function access with OpenIV’s powerful file browser, editor, and package installer (OIV). Built for creators and tinkerers, it streamlines **graphics tweaks, vehicle/ped packs, sound mods**, and **config edits** while preserving stability and performance through restore points and a mods folder approach.

> Use for **single‑player only**. Do **not** use mods in GTA Online. Switch back to a clean game folder before going online.
